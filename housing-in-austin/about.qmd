Austin, Texas, has emerged as one of the most dynamic and rapidly growing cities in the United States, experiencing a substantial influx of residents and job opportunities in recent years. However, this rapid growth has strained the housing market and construction, leading to a significant disparity between supply and demand. Consequently, the housing prices in Austin have faced a steep upward trend. 

Recognizing the challenges posed by this scenario, for our MUSA 550 final project we propose the development of a comprehensive project aimed at modeling the housing market and predicting housing prices based on a diverse set of housing characteristics. This initiative is designed to provide valuable insights for users, inform policy decisions, and assist consultants in navigating the evolving real estate landscape in Austin.
